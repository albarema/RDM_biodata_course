# Research Data Management for NGS data
</center>

**Updated:** *{{ git_revision_date_localized }}*

Research Data Management (RDM) for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data is a foundational course aimed at providing participants with fundamental knowledge and practical skills in handling the extensive data generated through modern NGS studies in the context of Open Science and FAIR principles. This course covers essential principles of RDM practices, such as data organization, metadata annotation, version control and archiving, enabling researchers to manage NGS data with confidence. Participants will also gain insights into FAIR principles and Open Science, fostering collaboration and reproducibility in NGS research. By the end of the course, attendees will be equipped with essential tools and techniques to navigate the data challenges prevalent in today's NGS research landscape.

!!! warning "Course Requirements"
    - Understanding Next Generation Sequencing data and formats.

This course provides participants with an overall introduction to effectively manage the vast amounts of data generated in modern NGS studies. Participants will gain a practical understanding of RDM principles and the significance of handling NGS data efficiently. The course covers the unique characteristics of NGS data, its life cycle, and the importance of adopting Open Science and FAIR principles for data accessibility and reusability.

Throughout the course, participants will learn useful skills for organizing NGS data, including creating folder and file structures and implementing metadata to enhance data discoverability and interpretation. Effective data management plans (DMPs) tailored to NGS data will be explored, ensuring data integrity and compliance with institutional and funding agency requirements. Attendees will also gain insights into setting up databases and using version control systems to track changes in data analysis, promoting collaboration and reproducibility.

The course concludes with a focus on archiving and data repositories, enabling participants to preserve and share NGS data for long-term scientific consumption. By the end of the program, attendees will be equipped with the necessary tools and techniques to navigate the challenges prevalent in today's NGS research landscape, fostering successful data management practices and enhancing collaboration in the scientific community.
