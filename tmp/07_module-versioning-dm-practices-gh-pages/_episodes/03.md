title: "Setting up versioning on your computer"
teaching: 20
exercises: 20
questions:
- How do you get started with versioning using Git on your own computer?
objectives:
  - Creating and pushing local repositories
  - How to record (commit) changes
  - Inspecting changes before they are committed
  - Browsing changes

keypoints:
- With Github Desktop, we can do everything we can on the web 
- A **remote** links a repository on your computer to a remote repository on a server
- You can **push** changes made on your computer to a remote server
- You can **pull** changes made on a remote server to your computer
- Additionally, all of this can be done using a command line interface

> ### About this episode 
> We will practice creating a new repository using GitHub Desktop, committing changes to it, browsing the changes, creating branches, and more. This is practically the same as the previous episode, but we introduce
> some new concepts:
> 
> - There are now two copies of your repository: that on your computer,
>   and that on Github.
> - We introduce the concepts of **pull** and **fetch** to move code
>   GitHub→local, and **push** to move code local→GitHub.
> - **GitHub Desktop** is an application that lets you manage files with
>   Git. It is *not* the only way to use Git, but it is easy and
>   integrated, so it's a nice thing to use.
> - One can share existing projects also using the web interface, so GitHub Desktop
>   is *not* the only way to make an existing project available on GitHub.
> 
> In small groups it can be useful to do this side by side (in-person) or one
> learner shares their screen (video) and others can ask questions and give
> suggestions. In a larger group the instructor can demonstrate these and then
> participants can try on their own and then ask questions.

## Step 1: Create an example spreadsheet

In this exercise, we will share a data file in CSV (comma-separated
values) format and see how GitHub nicely displays it. First, we
need to make some CSV file.

Either create a new CSV file:
- Create a spreadsheet with Excel/LibreOffice or similar, containing some fantasy data
- Export the spreadsheet to CSV format

If you don't feel like creating a new CSV file, you can download an example
[here](../data/samples_metadata_lesson.csv):
- Right-click and "Save as..."

Make sure the file is actually in CSV format, not Excel/spreadsheet
format.

## Step 2: Initialize a repository with GitHub Desktop

First, we make a new local repository. At this stage, the repository
will only exist on our computer, not yet on GitHub.

- Start GitHub Desktop
- Click on "+ Create a New Repository on your hard drive..."

![creating](../fig/creating-using-desktop/creating.png)


## Step 3: Commit the CSV data file

Now, we add the CSV to git.  First, we put it in the git directory,
then tell git to save it.

- Copy your (own or downloaded) CSV file to the repository folder
- Note how GitHub desktop changed and shows you the changes
- Make a commit

![diff-before-commit](../fig/creating-using-desktop/diff-before-commit.png)


## Step 4: Publish the repository on GitHub

This is the step where we actually upload it to Github.  Github
Desktop lets us create a new repository on github.com without using
the web browser.  In this step, we also **push** the changes to the
**remote** repository, though it happens without us seeing all the
middle steps.

- Browse the history (click "History")
- Don't use the same name as the previous episode
- You can choose between a private and a public repository
- Click "Publish repository" (this only publishes the current branch)
- After you have pushed, visit the repository via the website

![publish](../fig/creating-using-desktop/publish.png)


## Step 5: Create a branch, commit to it, and share it

This is pretty much the normal work: edit a file, commit it.  But, in
this case, we are going to **commit it to a new branch**.  Why?  We'll see
later.

- Make a change to the CSV file directly on your computer, but do not commit yet
- Observe the change you made in GitHub Desktop before committing
- Create a new branch on GitHub Desktop
- "Bring my changes to ..." the new branch:

![switch-branch](../fig/creating-using-desktop/switch-branch.png)

- Commit to the new branch on GitHub Desktop
- Publish the new branch to GitHub
- Browse your branches and changes on GitHub

---

## Step 6: Fetch and pull changes from the web

Now we show how to **fetch** or **pull** code from Github→local.

- Edit the file via the GitHub web interface and commit there to `main`
- Switch to GitHub Desktop
- Change current branch to `main`
- Click "Fetch origin"

![fetch-origin](../fig/creating-using-desktop/fetch-origin.png)

- Before continuing compare the histories on your computer and the network on GitHub and discuss what fetch did:

![network](../fig/creating-using-desktop/network.png)

- Click "Pull origin"

![pull-origin](../fig/creating-using-desktop/pull-origin.png)

- After pulling browse the "History" in GitHub Desktop

![after-pull](../fig/creating-using-desktop/after-pull.png)

What's the difference between **fetch** and **pull**?  Fetch gets the
changes, but doesn't apply them locally.  Pull = fetch + apply changes
locally in your current repository (does a **merge** which we will
discuss later).

> ## Summary
>
> With Github Desktop, we can do everything we can on the web, but it's
> more natural.  The most important concepts are that of **remotes**
> (links between repositories), **pushing**, and **pulling**.
>
> We don't cover it in this workshop, but you can eventually do all of
> these things from the command line, for example `git commit
> some_file.csv`.  Once you are doing many things, this can be faster.
> Still, there's almost always a place for applications like the GitHub Desktop
> and other graphical user interfaces to
> make things smoother.
