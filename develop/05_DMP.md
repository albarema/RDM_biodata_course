    ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​A Data Management Plan (DMP) is a planning tool that helps researchers to establish good practices for working with physical m​aterial and data in a research project. A DMP covers all relevant aspects of research data management throughout the project.
    Writing a DMP early on in a project helps:

    - identify potential issues with the management of research data.
    - comply with relevant legislation, policies, and funder requirements.
    - document agreements related to the collection, usage, and dissemination of research data between project partners or between student and supervisor.

We are have written a DMP template that it is prefilled with repetitive information using [DMPonline](https://dmponline.deic.dk/) and the Horizon Europe guidelines. This template contains all the necessary information regarding common practices that we will use, the repositories we use for NGS, etc. The template is part of the `project` folder template, under `documents`. You can check the file [here](https://github.com/brickmanlab/ngs-template/blob/master/project/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project%20%7D%7D/documents/Non-sensitive_NGS_research_project_template.docx).

The Horizon Europe template is mostly focused on digital data and so, it is maybe not the best option regarding the needs of the Brickman Lab, due to the fact that it is mostly a wet lab with some bioinformatics. We will start working on another DMP based on the KU template, which is designed for both physical and digital data.
