The datasets produced during a research project is a treasure on its own, and should be treated as such. When publicly available and appropriately described, they are ready to be re-used by yourself as well as others.  

This lesson will give you the why, where and how of data sharing via repository submission, including hands-on exercise on how to create a data publication plan. By the end of this lesson you will:
