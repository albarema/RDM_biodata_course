## Create a document
When the questions are answered it is time to produce the document with the DMP.

> ## How to collaborate (Optional)
> There might be situations where you want to share a link to a DMP:
>
> * Collaborators in the project needs to answer some questions
> 
> * A stakeholder want to view the answers
> 
> In order to make this possible, click on `Share` in the top right corner of the navigation bar.
>
> ![share](../fig/share.jpg)
>
> There are three ways of sharing: Add user, enable visibility, and creating a public link.
>
> Activate the `Public link` and select if you want the person with the link to **view** or **edit**, click on `Save`. 
>
> ![share_public_link](../fig/share_public_link.jpg)
>
> Now you can copy the link in the address bar (e.g. [https://dsw.scilifelab.se/projects/07d3fb1c-5941-4ac4-98c2-39409573bbb0](https://dsw.scilifelab.se/projects/07d3fb1c-5941-4ac4-98c2-39409573bbb0)) and share with whomever you want, without them having to log in!
>
> **Note:** We recommend to only allow anonymous users (i.e. those not specifically added to the project) to view, not edit. If you need a collaborator to add or update information in the project, use the `Add user` functionality instead.
