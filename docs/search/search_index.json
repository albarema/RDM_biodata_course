Course Requirements Understanding Next Generation Sequencing data and formats. This course provides participants with an overall introduction to effectively manage the vast amounts of data generated in modern NGS studies. Participants will gain a practical understanding of RDM principles and the significance of handling NGS data efficiently. The course covers the unique characteristics of NGS data, its life cycle, and the importance of adopting Open Science and FAIR principles for data accessibility and reusability. Throughout the course, participants will learn useful skills for organizing NGS data, including creating folder and file structures and implementing metadata to enhance data discoverability and interpretation. Effective data management plans (DMPs) tailored to NGS data will be explored, ensuring data integrity and compliance with institutional and funding agency requirements. Attendees will also gain insights into setting up databases and using version control systems to track changes in data analysis, promoting collaboration and reproducibility. The course concludes with a focus on archiving and data repositories, enabling participants to preserve and share NGS data for long-term scientific consumption. By the end of the program, attendees will be equipped with the necessary tools and techniques to navigate the challenges prevalent in today's NGS research landscape, fostering successful data management practices and enhancing collaboration in the scientific community. Goals By the end of this workshop, you should be able to apply the following concepts in the context of Next Generation Sequencing data: Understand what is RDM and why it is important Understand FAIR and Open Science Principles Structure and establish naming conventions your files and folders Add relevant metadata to your data Select a repository to archive your data Version control your data analysis Make your data analysis and workflows reproducible Write a Data Management Plan for your NGS data Acknowledgements \u00b6 University of Copenhagen Research Data Management Team.

Learn the basics about what is Research Data Management 2. Learn why good RDM are important The University of Copenhagen (UCPH) defines Research Data Management (RDM) as a \"collective term for the planning, collection, storage, sharing and preservation of research data\" 1 . RDM is of paramount importance in modern scientific investigations due to the exponential growth of data in various disciplines, particularly in fields like genomics, climate research, and social sciences. Effectively managing research data offers several key benefits: First, it enhances the reliability and credibility of research findings by providing a transparent and structured approach to data collection, organization, and analysis. Second, RDM promotes data discoverability, allowing researchers to locate and utilize existing data for new investigations, thus maximizing the value of research efforts. Third, proper data management facilitates collaboration and knowledge sharing within the scientific community, accelerating the pace of discoveries and advancements. Finally, RDM ensures compliance with ethical and legal requirements, safeguarding sensitive data and promoting responsible data use. By adopting robust RDM practices, researchers can optimize their workflow, increase research impact, and contribute to the overall progress of science. What is Research Data Management \u00b6 While the meaning of Research Data Management might be obvious, it is a good idea to break down its components to make a good sense of what it implies. Let's start with Management , which is rather simple! Meaning of Management The literal meaning of Management is \"the practice of managing; handling, supervision, or control.\" On the other hand, we have Research Data : Meaning of Research Data In accordance with the UCPH Policy for Research Data Management 1 , research data encompasses both physical material and digital information gathered, observed, produced, or formulated during research activities carried out at UCPH. This broad definition includes various types of data serving as the foundation for the research, such as specimens, notebooks, interviews, texts, literature, digital raw data, recordings, computer code, and meticulous documentation of these materials and data, forming the core of the analysis that underlies the research outcomes. So, our goal is to handle and control the data that we generate during our research, including both physical and digital data! This must be done throughout the whole life cycle of the data . Nonetheless, we will focus on the digital part of our data. Warning This workshop focuses on RDM of digital data and how it was generated! Research Data Cycle \u00b6 The Research Data Life Cycle is a conceptual framework that illustrates the various stages that research data goes through during its lifetime, from its initial creation or collection to its eventual archiving or disposal. It provides a structured approach to managing research data effectively, ensuring data integrity, accessibility, and reusability. We will talk about the Research Data Life Cycle in the third lesson . Research Data Life Cycle, University of Copenhagen RDM guidelines. Why is Research Data Management important \u00b6 Effective data management can significantly benefit research, providing advantages for individual researchers: Careful planning aids in the early identification and resolution of potential issues, aligns expectations among collaborators, and clarifies data rights and ownership. Thorough data documentation streamlines the process of locating and comprehending previous research, promoting efficiency and building upon existing knowledge. Conducting risk assessments and devising robust data storage and security strategies mitigate the risk of data loss, breaches, or unauthorized use, safeguarding valuable research assets. Sharing data with others beyond the project's conclusion enhances research visibility and fosters increased citations, expanding the impact of the findings. Developing a data preservation plan ensures the long-term availability of research data well after the project's completion, contributing to data accessibility and continued research relevance.
