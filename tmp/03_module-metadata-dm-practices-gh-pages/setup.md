> ## Software

> To interact with the files in this lesson, we need a program that can display tabular data, such as a spreadsheet program. We can use Goggle spreadsheet, LibreOffice, Microsoft Excel, Gnumeric, OpenOffice.org, Numbers (MacOS), or other programs. Commands may differ a bit between programs, but the general ideas of thinking around spreadsheets are the same.

> Do make sure you have installed such a program on your computer.
