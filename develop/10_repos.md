## 6. `Project` archiving in Zenodo

Before submitting, link the repository to [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) and then create a Git release. This release will be caught by Zenodo and will give you a DOI that you can submit along the manuscript.

## 7. Data upload to GEO

The raw data from NGS experiments will be uploaded to the [Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).
Whenever a new Assay folder is created, the data owner must fill up the required documentation and information needed to make the GEO submission as smooth as possible.
